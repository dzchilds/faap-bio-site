I am modelling the evolution of herbicide resistance in black grass (*Alopecurus myosuroides*), and applying optimisation tools to those models to find better intergrated weed managment stratergies. I have a wide range of other research interestes centered around demography and invasive species managment, [click here for more details](http://shauncouttsecology.com/).
